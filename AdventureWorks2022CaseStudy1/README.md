This case study analyzed a subset of data from the Adventure Works 2022 dataset. This dataset can be found here <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=ssms>.

The goal was to identify the top-performing items in terms of revenue and units sold for the year 2022, as well as determine which items had the highest revenue and units sold in each territory.

Three final artifacts were produced: a PowerPoint slide of the analysis (Final-Report.pptx), a PowerBI dashboard (adventure-works-sales.pbix), and a PDF of the PowerBI dashboard (adventure-works-sales.pdf). 

The analysis proceeded as follows:
1. Load data into SQL Server Management Studio
2. Query data to answer business questions
3. Export query results into Excel workbook
4. Create visualizations in Excel
5. Create a final report and analysis in PowerPoint titled, "Final-Report"

The PowerBI analysis proceeded as follows:
1. Connect PowerBI to the Adventure Works 2022 database in SQL Server Management Studio
2. Create dashboard
3. Create PDF
