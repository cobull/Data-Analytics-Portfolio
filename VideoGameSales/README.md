The goal of this project was to analyze video game sales from 1971 - 2024 to identify broad trends. The analysis was performed in RStudio and produced two artifacts, a .rmd file (R Markdown) and a .pdf file. The R Markdown file produces the .pdf file when knitted. 

The dataset can be found here: <https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?page=2&pageSize=5>
